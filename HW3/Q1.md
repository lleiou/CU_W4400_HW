#W4400 HW3 Q1
#AdaBoost
#seems a little bit difficult.
#I think the most difficult part of this method is the way
#we generate the new classifier after assigning the new weight to the 
#n data points
#what's more, the decision stump part statement on the hw sheet also is misleading me...
#At first I don't know why we should find a unique j and theta when the final classifier 
#is the aggression of various classifiers...
#but now i know that we are just looking for a optimal j, 
#theta and m for every iteration..


#Actually, I read a whole bunch of materials about the adaboost, 
#for most of them, the equations have a similar different frim the one on our own slides, 
#that is they will divide a z when calculating the new weights...
#I don't know wheather this will cause a differece in the final result.

#Although I understand this part, 
#I still find it confusing how we conduct a cross validation to the data
#should we code all the original process 
#or just use the package which will do cross validation?

#one more question, what is the iteration time B? 
#i.e. How do we decide when it is time to stop iteration any more?

# OK, here comes my code...
